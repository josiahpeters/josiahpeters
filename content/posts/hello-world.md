# Hello World

This website is dedicated to my wife, my children, and their future generations. It is also dedicated to those who have come before me. Generationally speaking, my grandfather Ralph Peters and my father Daniel Peters had the ability to create anything they could imagine. I like to think this skill has been passed down to me through the way I was raised. Unfortunately most of the evidence of my grandfather's shenanigans were lost when their home caught fire days after the 1991 Northridge earthquake. I'm hoping to help preserve this quality that I learned from them for future generations by documenting what someone is capable of if they don't know any better than to work hard at trying to accomplish something outside of their reach.

If you want to learn more about me or my family, please visit my About Me page.


 I hope to use this site to catalog my learnings and showcase some of the fun projects I have worked on over the years. Hopefully by going through the exercise of documenting and sharing something, I will force myself to question my understanding of that subject. This should force me to have a better understanding of the subject.
